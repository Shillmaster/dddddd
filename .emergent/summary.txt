<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to set up a full-stack application from a provided GitHub repository: . The initial request was to set up the frontend, backend (an isolated module named Fractal), and a MongoDB database.

Subsequent user requests evolved the task to:
1.  Integrate the Fractal module as a new section within an existing, comprehensive admin panel.
2.  Fix the authentication system for the main admin panel.
3.  Implement a new Regime Alert System (BLOCK 67-68) with a corresponding backend API and a new Alerts tab in the UI.
4.  Perform a cosmetic UI/UX overhaul of the Fractal admin panel to make it more modern and understandable for non-technical moderators. This includes adding tooltips with explanations.
5.  Unify the language and design across all tabs in the Fractal admin module, keeping technical terms/metrics in English and providing all descriptions and help text in Russian.

**User's preferred language**: Russian. The user communicates exclusively in Russian. The next agent MUST respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a complex full-stack trading analysis tool with a React frontend and a TypeScript/Fastify backend. The environment is fully set up and running.

- **Backend**: The TypeScript backend is operational, connected to MongoDB, and serves all necessary APIs. It runs in an isolated FRACTAL_ONLY mode.
- **Frontend**: The React frontend is compiled and running without errors.
- **Admin Panel**: A comprehensive admin panel exists with a sidebar navigation structure.
- **Authentication**: Admin authentication is working. Credentials are  / .
- **Fractal Module Integration**: The Fractal module has been successfully integrated into the main admin panel's navigation sidebar under Modules.
- **Alert System (BLOCK 67-68)**: The backend API for the alert system is fully implemented, including endpoints for listing alerts, checking quotas, and running checks. The frontend Alerts tab is also implemented.
- **UI/UX Overhaul**: The Overview tab of the Fractal admin panel has been completely redesigned with a cleaner layout, progress bars, and informative tooltips in Russian, while keeping technical terms in English. The Volatility and Alerts tabs have also been updated to this new standard.

**Last working item**:
The agent was in the process of applying the new unified UI/UX design to all tabs within the Fractal admin panel, as requested by the user.

- **Last item agent was working**: Unifying the UI/UX of the **Shadow** tab to match the new design standard (English technical terms, Russian descriptions/tooltips). The agent had already updated the  and  tabs.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool. The agent needs to verify the UI of the  page to ensure the design is consistent with the other tabs and that the new tooltips are functional.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The current work is a feature enhancement/task completion.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete UI/UX unification for the Fractal admin panel (P0)**
    - **Where to resume**: The agent needs to update the components for the **Shadow** tab. The primary files to modify are  and .
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A consistent, polished, and user-friendly UI across all tabs of the Fractal admin module, fulfilling the user's explicit request for a clear visual hierarchy.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **P0: **: This is the next logical step after the UI is finalized. It involves activating the backend alert triggers (e.g., Regime Shift, Health Drop) so they automatically generate alerts based on data changes. This will primarily involve backend work in  and the daily cron job that runs it.
- **P1: **: Enhance the Alerts tab UI by adding deep links from each alert to the relevant section of the admin panel (e.g., an alert about volatility links directly to the Volatility tab, pre-filtered to the time of the event).

**Future Tasks:**
- ****: Implement API endpoints for exporting and verifying the model contract for compliance purposes.
- ****: Create a service to generate and send a weekly summary report via Telegram.
- ****: Perform a code audit and refactor to ensure the Fractal module is fully isolated and can be used as a portable plug-in.
- ****: Implement business-oriented features such as tiered user access, monetization, and public-facing dashboards.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Setup**: Cloned the repository and successfully configured the entire full-stack application (React, TypeScript/Fastify, MongoDB).
- **Admin Integration**: Integrated the standalone  pages into the main platform admin panel, including adding it to the navigation sidebar ().
- **Authentication Fix**: Debugged and fixed the admin login flow by adding missing routes to the backend's isolated run mode and correcting a frontend bug where the response body was read twice.
- **Alert System (BLOCK 67-68)**: Implemented the backend API and frontend UI for a comprehensive alert system, including rate-limiting, statistics, and a history log.
- **UI/UX Overhaul (Overview Tab)**: Redesigned the Overview tab in the Fractal admin panel with a modern aesthetic, clearer data visualization, and Russian tooltips for non-technical users ( and associated cards).
- **UI/UX Unification (Volatility & Alerts Tabs)**: Extended the new design and language standard to the Volatility and Alerts tabs.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React,  for configuration overrides, JavaScript (JSX).
- **Backend**: TypeScript, Fastify (web framework), Mongoose (MongoDB ODM).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Architecture**: Modular full-stack application. The backend runs as a Node.js process managed by a Python proxy () and .

**key DB schema**
- **fractal_alerts_log**:
    - : 'BTC'
    - : String ('REGIME_SHIFT', 'HEALTH_DROP', etc.)
    - : String ('INFO', 'HIGH', 'CRITICAL')
    - : String (for deduplication)
    - : Object (detailed metrics at the time of the alert)
    - : String ('NONE', 'DEDUP', 'QUOTA')
    - : Date

**All files of reference**
- : Next file to be updated.
- : Next file to be updated.
- : Reusable component containing Russian explanations. New tooltips may need to be added here.
- : Defines the structure of the admin sidebar.
- : Core backend logic for the alert system.
- : Entry point for the isolated Fractal backend; any new core routes must be registered here.

**key api endpoints**
- **Authentication**: 
- **Fractal Admin Data**: 
- **Alerts API**:
    -  (List alerts)
    -  (Check rate-limit status)
    -  (Manually trigger alert check)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Language**: The user is Russian. You MUST communicate in Russian. All UI text for explanation/guidance should be in Russian, while technical labels and metrics must remain in English.
- **Authentication**: The admin credentials are **username:** , **password:** .
- **FRACTAL_ONLY Mode**: The backend runs in an isolated mode via . If any core platform features (like auth) seem to be missing, you may need to import and register their modules in this file.
- **Telegram is not configured**: The alert system is designed to send Telegram messages, but the  and  environment variables are not set. This is expected. The system should function correctly, but no messages will be sent. Do not ask the user for these credentials.
